## Inspiration

We wanted to make something that makes people happy :) Something that gives the user the ability to customise their browsing experience and inspire creativity in everyday activities.

We are a team with various backgrounds in Music tech, Mechatronics, HCI and Graphics. None of us have done chrome extensions before and were inspired by other fun extensions that we have used. This was the main motivation while also giving us the opportunity to learn something new.


## What it does

* Walking left and right
* Bumping its head if you scroll too much
* Clicking links for you
* Taking naps
* Playing music
* Erasing text
* Makes graffiti art
* Following mouse cursor


## Challenges we ran into

- Hybrid team working across global timezone
- New framework as we are doing the development
- Balancing workload
- Communicating expectations and aligning on the MVP


## What we learned

- Working with a Hybrid team can be difficult 
- Important to align on expectations in advances 
- Have continuous communication and sync
